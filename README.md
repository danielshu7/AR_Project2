# AR_Project2
For this project, I used Unity and Vuforia in order to create AR elements on the front and back covers of The Last of the Mohicans. The code can be pulled from this repository and ran using Unity Hub.  The scene is located at Assets/Scenes/Bookcover.unity. The image targets are placed in the Assets directory; the front cover is "Bookcover.jpg" and the back cover "Back Cover_1.jpg". The interactive element is a virtual button on the back cover of the book.  The button is located over the middle barcode at the bottom of the cover.  When covered, it should toggle off the AR book information and instead display my review of the book.

One limitation is that the virtual button does not always work seemlessly.  Sometimes when covering it, there will be flickering between the book information and the review.  Perhaps this is a problem of sensitivity though I was not able to find a level that was totally consistent.  Another limitation is that there is no smooth transition when going from front cover to back cover.  Perhaps changing the setting of when the target is being counted as visible could improve this though I believe it might come with its own downsides.  On the webcam especially, it would also often take quite a while for the Image Target to be found. This is most likely due to poor camera quality as well as suboptimal lighting conditions.  As expected, these problems were all less noticeable through my phone camera.
