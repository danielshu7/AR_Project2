# AR_Project2
For this project, I used Unity and Vuforia in order to create AR elements on the front and back covers of The Last of the Mohicans. The code can be pulled from this repository and ran using Unity Hub.  The scene is located at Assets/Scenes/Bookcover.unity. The image targets are placed in the Assets directory; the front cover is "Bookcover.jpg" and the back cover "Back Cover_1.jpg". The interactive element is a virtual button on the back cover of the book.  The button is located over the middle barcode at the bottom of the cover.  When covered, it should toggle off the AR book information and instead display my review of the book.
